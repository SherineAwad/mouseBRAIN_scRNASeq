# Mouse Brain scRNA-seq Analysis

This project contains single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from mouse brain cortex and striatum regions. The data were processed and analyzed using **Scanpy**, enabling identification and visualization of distinct cell populations across these brain areas.

The analysis includes data normalization, clustering, cell type annotation, and dimensionality reduction (UMAP), providing insights into the cellular composition and heterogeneity of the mouse brain cortex and striatum.

The raw and processed data files can be accessed from the following Google Drive folder:
